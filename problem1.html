    <h1> Chemistry Assignment </h1>
    <p> Chemistry is the branch of science that deals with the properties, composition, and behaviour of matter. It is a
        fascinating field that explores the building blocks of the universe.</p>
    <h2> Chemical Elements</h2>
    <p> The <mark>periodic table</mark> is a tabular arrangement of chemical elements. Each element is represented by
        its chemical sysmbol, such as Fe for iron, H for hydrogen and O for oxygen. Elements are classified into groups
        and periods based on their properties.</p>
    <h3> Chemical Equations</h3>
    <p> Chemical reactions are represented using <i>chemical equations.</i> Here's an example of a <i>chemical
            reaction:</i></p>
    <p>2H<sub>2</sub> + O<sub>2</sub> -> 2H<sub>2</sub>O</p>
    <p>This equation represents the reaction between hydrogen gas(<em>H<sub>2</sub></em>) and oxygen gas
        (<em>O<sub>2</sub></em>) to form a water (<em>H<sub>2</sub>O</em>).</p>
    <h4> Important Concepts</h4>
    <p> Stoichiometry is the calculation of reactants and products in chemical reactions. It involves balancing chemical
        equations to ensure mass and charge are conserved.</p>
    <p> <sub>Subscripts</sub> indicate the number of atoms of each element in a molecule, while <sup>Superscripts</sup>
        reperesents charges or the number of atoms in an ion.</p>
    <h5>Conclusion</h5>
    <p> Chemistryplays a crucial role in understanding the world around us. From the composition of the air we breathe
        to the reactions that power our bodies, chemistry influences every aspect of our lives.</p>
